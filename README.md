# üåÄ Convexor

2024 Computer Graphics project at [RAF](https://raf.edu.rs/)

**Convexor** is a minimalistic 2D graphics engine and game written in **C**, built entirely around a single core operation ‚Äî  
**drawing one pixel at coordinate `(x, y)` with color `(r, g, b)`**.  

Everything visible on screen ‚Äî lines, polygons, collisions, textures, camera motion, and even AI mob behavior ‚Äî  
is derived from that fundamental function. The project uses **RAFGL** and **GLFW** only to open a window  
and display the pixel buffer; all geometry and rendering are done manually on the CPU.

## üéØ Educational Focus

Convexor was designed as a **teaching tool for computer graphics and geometric algorithms**,  
illustrating how an entire interactive world can be built from first principles:

- How pixels become **geometry** through rasterization.  
- How geometry becomes **motion** through mathematical transformations.  
- How procedural generation and simple AI create **emergent behavior**.  
- How all of it integrates into a coherent **rendering pipeline** with no engine, shaders, or GPU acceleration.

This project aims to bridge the gap between **algorithmic geometry** and **visual computing**,  
demonstrating the inner workings of a software renderer through readable, modular C code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

- **Language:** C (C99)  
- **Libraries:** [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), OpenGL (via Glad), RAFGL  
- **Build system:** `make all`  
- **Dependencies:** Standard C libraries + GLFW  

Convexor renders directly to a framebuffer using **world-space** and **local-space** coordinates.  
Procedural generation populates the environment with convex polygons, food shards, and concave AI mobs.  
Each frame is the result of thousands of explicit pixel writes.

## üß† Gameplay and Simulation

You control a **convex polygon** in a procedurally generated world.  
By consuming **food shards**, your polygon grows and gains mass.  
Around you, **concave AI mobs** wander and chase you using geometry-based pursuit logic.  

The **camera** operates in world space, smoothly following the player‚Äôs center of mass,  
and a **vignette post-effect** applies a darkened falloff toward the screen edges.

## üß© Code Structure

| Module | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `geometry.h` | Core geometric primitives (vectors, lines, triangles, rectangles) and transformations. |
| `convexhull.h` / `concavehull.h` | Data structures for convex and concave polygons with triangulation and area computation. |
| `polygon.h` | High-level polygon intersection, bounding boxes, and rasterization. |
| `segment.h` | Line clipping and incremental line drawing (Cohen‚ÄìSutherland style). |
| `food_shards.h` | Procedural spawning and regeneration of collectible convex shapes. |
| `hostile_mob.h` | Concave **AI mobs** with scale-based movement, pursuit, and reaction logic. |
| `protagonist.h` | Player entity with keyboard-controlled rotation, motion, and scaling. |
| `camera.h` | World-to-screen transformation, parallax background, and vignette rendering. |
| `main_state.c` | Core loop integrating input, geometry, AI, and rendering. |
| `myrandom.h` | Randomization utilities for procedural generation. |
| `globals.h` | Shared constants and world configuration. |

## üßÆ Core Loop

Each frame (`main_state_update()`):

1. **Input & Movement**  
   `take_input() ‚Üí move_protagonist() ‚Üí move_hmobs()`
2. **Procedural World Updates**  
   `protagonist_eat_food(), hmobs_eat_food(), protagonist_fight_enemies()`
3. **Camera & Rendering**  
   `move_camera(), draw_background(), draw_all_shards(), draw_hostile_mobs(), draw_protagonist()`
4. **Post-Processing**  
   `postfx()` applies vignette and tonal correction, then the pixel buffer is blitted via `rafgl_texture_show()`.

Each object ‚Äî food, mob, player ‚Äî exists in world coordinates,  
projected to the screen purely through mathematical transformation.

## üß± Building & Running

### Requirements
- GLFW 3.x  
- OpenGL 3.3+  
- GCC / Clang / MinGW  

### Configuration
Edit your GLFW path in the **Makefile**:
```make
GLFW_DIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/GLFW
GLFW_INC = $(GLFW_DIR)/include
GLFW_LIB = $(GLFW_DIR)/lib
```

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

Convexor performs **all rasterization on the CPU**, pixel by pixel ‚Äî  
there are **no GPU shaders**, **no multithreading**, and **no hardware acceleration**.  

Performance scales linearly with resolution:  
it runs smoothly at **800√ó600**, but higher resolutions will cause **noticeable slowdowns**,  
especially when many **AI mobs** or complex geometric shapes are active on screen.  

This is **intentional** ‚Äî the project is designed as an **educational example** of  
how a **software rasterizer** works internally.  
Each frame directly reveals the **computational cost** of geometry and rendering operations  
before any optimization, threading, or GPU offloading is applied.
